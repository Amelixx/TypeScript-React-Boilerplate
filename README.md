# TypeScript React App Boilerplate
I got tired of using create-react-app because of how much stuff I end up not needing, so I went and figured out to just make a barebones TypeScript React app that doesn't have anything but React and Typescript.

Theroetically this should work by running `npm i` and then `npm start`.

If stuff like the jest testing library or eslint are wanted, they can be installed separately, I can't be bothered to make a build tool so if you wanna use it I'd recommend just cloning the repo and then deleting the .git folder in order to make your own repository for a new project.
